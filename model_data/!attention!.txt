detect the image 
$ python yolo_video.py --image 

detect the video
$ python yolo_video.py --input

the trained_weights_final.h5 is the same to trained_weights_final_bigv.h5
and the yolo_weights.h5 is the original file from yolo

and the trained_weights_final on the desktop is my first version of mask_detection training(poor show)

you can edit the "model_path": 'model_data/trained_weights_final.h5' in yolo.py to change another model.h5
